## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** 
- ![vite](./src/assets/vite.svg) Vite
- ![react](./src/assets/react.svg) React
- ![html](./src/assets/html.svg) HTML
- ![css](./src/assets/css.svg) CSS
- ![javascript](./src/assets/javascript.svg) JavaScript

This is a React project created using Vite. By using the Fetch API, requests are made to the TheCocktailDB API. The API returns a list of drink information including photos, ingredients, and mixing instructions. You can then filter the drink list by selecting an ingredient.

## Optimizations

I would like to automate the image carousel by implementing features like play and pause.

## Lessons Learned:

Cycling through images can be tricky! I learned how to implement both arrows and navigation dots to produce a seamless scrolling effect with the drink images.
